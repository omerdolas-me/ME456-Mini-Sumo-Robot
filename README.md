# ME456 Mini Sumo Robot Project

This repository contains files and documentation for the **ME456 Mechatronics Project**, where we built a **Mini Sumo Robot** using Arduino-based programming.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into multiple **branches**, each containing specific files and progress related to the project:

### Competition
Contains final robot design, Arduino/mBlock codes, and media files used during the **Mini Sumo Robot Competition**.  
Includes strategy implementations (attack, defense, and avoidance) using **Finite State Machine (FSM)** logic.

### Workshops
Step-by-step lab and workshop studies conducted before the final competition:

- **Workshop #1: Ultrasonic Distance Measurement**    

- **Workshop #2: PWM Speed Control and Ultrasonic Radar**  

- **Workshop #3: Triangulation with two sensors**   

- **Workshop #4: Autonomous navigation on dohyo**
